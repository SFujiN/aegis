/*! \mainpage Aegis Voting System Project Documentation
 *
 * \section intro_sec Introduction
 *
 * The purpose of these documents is to provide detailed documentation of the
 * Aegis program that operates on the two types of voting systems, namely Open
 * Party Listing(OPL) and Instant Runoff(IR). This software will take in a csv
 * file and determine the outcome based on the two types of voting systems (OPL
 * or IR). This documentation is provided to show the structure, classes and
 * functions used in order to run a voting system.
 *
 * The program Aegis can be built with a provided makefile is the src folder
 *
 * $ make
 *
 * from within the folder where the executable is built usage of Aegis is done
 * using:
 *
 * $ ./Aegis <file_name>
